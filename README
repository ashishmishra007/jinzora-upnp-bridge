This project allows your Jinzora server to be browsed as a UPnP Media Server. By setting this service up on your home network, you can, for example, browse your Jinzora content on a Playstation 3, Windows Media Player, or other UPnP compatible device.

The UPnP bridge must be run on the network in which you'd like to connect to your UPnP devices, but the Jinzora server can be hosted remotely.

This UPnP service is also available in the Jinzora Mobile for Android application.

You must configure your service using the src/main/resources/jinzora.properties file.
